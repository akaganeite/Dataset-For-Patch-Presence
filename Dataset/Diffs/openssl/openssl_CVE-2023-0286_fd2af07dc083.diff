  Changes between 1.0.2zf and 1.0.2zg [xx XXX xxxx]
 
-  *)
+  *) Fixed a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing
+     inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING
+     but subsequently interpreted by GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE. This
+     vulnerability may allow an attacker who can provide a certificate chain or
+     CRL (neither of which need have a valid signature) to pass arbitrary
+     pointers to a memcmp call, creating a possible read primitive, subject to
+     some constraints. Refer to the advisory for more information. Thanks to
+     David Benjamin for discovering this issue. (CVE-2023-0286)
+
+     This issue has been fixed by changing the public header file definition of
+     GENERAL_NAME so that x400Address reflects the implementation. It was not
+     possible for any existing application to successfully use the existing
+     definition; however, if any application references the x400Address field
+     (e.g. in dead code), note that the type of this field has changed. There is
+     no ABI change.
